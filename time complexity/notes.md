That's a totally fair concern — **time complexity** can seem abstract, especially with all the Big O notation and logarithms. But don’t worry — you don’t need to be a math expert to understand what's **good**, what's **bad**, and how to **estimate** time complexity.

Let’s simplify it.

## 🚦 What's "Good" and "Bad" Time Complexity?

### ✅ **Good Time Complexities**
These are usually acceptable in **coding rounds and interviews**, especially for `n ≤ 10^5` or `10^6`:

| Complexity     | Typical Performance            |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| O(1)           | Instant (constant time)        |
| O(log n)       | Very fast (e.g., binary search)|
| O(n)           | Linear (acceptable for large n)|
| O(n log n)     | Efficient sorting or divide & conquer |

---

### ⚠️ **Borderline / Depends**
| Complexity      | Acceptable only for small `n` (up to ~10^3–10^4) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| O(n²)           | Too slow for large input                         |
| O(n³), O(2^n)   | Very slow unless `n` is very small (like ≤ 20)   |

---

### ❌ **Bad Complexities (Slow)**
- **O(n²)** or worse with `n = 10^5` → **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)**  
- **O(2^n)** → Acceptable only for small `n` (like 20)

---

## 👀 How to *Estimate* What Complexity is OK?
Remember this table:

| `n` (size of input) | Max complexity allowed     |
|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 10^6                 | O(n)                       |
| 10^5                 | O(n log n)                 |
| 10^3                 | O(n²)                      |
| 20                   | O(2^n), backtracking       |
| 10                   | O(n!), brute-force permute |

So when you see a problem with `n = 10^5`, aim for:
✅ O(n) or O(n log n)  
❌ O(n²) or worse

## 🧠 Quick Rules (No Log Calculations Needed)

- `log n` means: we divide the problem in half each time (e.g., binary search)
- `n log n` often means: sorting, mergesort, or divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Loops inside loops = often O(n²) → danger for big `n`
- Sorting is O(n log n) — acceptable for up to 10^6 elements

---

## 📌 Example for Practice:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // O(n^2)
    }
}
```

This is **O(n²)** → ❌ Bad if `n = 10^5`
