Yes — you're **100% right**, and you’ve just hit a **key insight** that many beginners take a long time to realize:

> ✅ **Time complexity depends on your coding style and logic.**

## 🔁 Loop-based logic vs Hash-based logic

Let’s say you want to **check if a duplicate exists** in an array.

### ❌ Naive (Nested loops):
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
        if (arr[i] == arr[j]) {
            // duplicate found
        }
    }
}
// O(n²)
```

### ✅ Optimized using Hash Table:
```cpp
unordered_set<int> seen;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (seen.count(arr[i])) {
        // duplicate found
    }
    seen.insert(arr[i]);
}
// O(n)
```

The logic is the same — **find duplicates** — but:
- One is **slow** (`O(n²)`), brute force.
- One is **fast** (`O(n)`), by using better data structures.

---

## 💡 Time complexity improves when:
- You use **hash maps/sets** for quick lookups → `O(1)` average
- You avoid **nested loops** where not needed
- You use **sorting + two pointers** for smarter traversal → `O(n log n)`
- You apply **binary search** instead of linear search → `O(log n)`

---

## 🎯 Final Tip:
Always ask yourself:
> **"Can I reduce nested loops using a hash table, sorting, or binary search?"**

That's how you shift from brute force to optimal.
